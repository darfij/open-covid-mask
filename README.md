COVID homemade Face Mask aiming for N95 (EN149-2001) or better performance

VORK IN PROGRES aims are still to be met!
This mask is OF COURSE dangerous to use and sould not be used!!
  -the full list of dangers is too log to be posted here and a simple google "respirator DIY danger" will provide all the information         needed

Tease are files, instructions and colaborations to build a open source "homemadable" printed face mask that aims to be easy printable, protect against the 128nm COVID-19 virus both by pasive filtration and by active virus suppresion.
The aim is to have a mask that is better then single use, but not for prolonged multiple use, can be printed from any filament on any printer. The filters can be made at home from house hold materials, the active virus suppresion is achived by nano coper and nano silver particles also easily produced at home.

Colabotation is needed in:
-moving the cad design to FreeCAD
-co-ordinating participants
-testing the design
-measuring actual filtration, pressure differential and antibio performance
-continuusly improving the design
