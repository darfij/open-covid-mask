COVID homemade Face Mask is aiming for N95 (EN149-2001) or better performance

**WORK IN PROGRESS** aims are still to be met!

This mask is **OF COURSE** dangerous to use and should not be used!!
* the full list of dangers is too long to be posted here and a simple google "respirator DIY danger" will provide all the information         needed

Aiming to design a face mask that meets many important criteria like:
* is safe
* filters (pacifies)123nm particles to a significant degree
* adheres to the wearers face preventing leakage
* can be made with a 3d printer and household supplies
* does not irritate the skin

It is of course difficult but I propose it is not impossible and I challenge all willing to collaborate to help in this joint attempt.

Here in Croatia we are currently fighting two major threats that both deplete the face mask supply.
Besides the covid-19 pandemic we had a earthquake in Zagreb with disastrous impact on city center buildings.
There are no dust protection masks to be found!

Here you will find work in progress on 3 different types of masks that can be 3d printed. Determination of their suitability , optimisation of production, testing, availability are the areas we need your help with.

  
These are the files, instructions and collaborations to build an open source "homemadable" printed face mask that aims to be easy to print,
protect against the 128nm COVID-19 virus both by passive filtration and by active virus suppression.
The aim is to have a mask that is better than the single use models, not for prolonged multiple use,
can be printed from any filament on any printer. The filters can be made at home using household materials, the active virus suppression is achieved by nano copper and nano silver particles also easily produced at home.

Collaboration is needed in:
* moving the cad design to FreeCAD
* writing and proofing instructions (text, pictures, youtube)
* co-ordinating participants
* testing the design
* measuring actual filtration, pressure differential and antibio performance
* continuously improving the design
