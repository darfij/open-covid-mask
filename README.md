COVID homemade Face Mask aiming for N95 (EN149-2001) or better performance

**WORK IN PROGRESS** aims are still to be met!

This mask is **OF COURSE** dangerous to use and should not be used!!
* the full list of dangers is too log to be posted here and a simple google "respirator DIY danger" will provide all the information         needed

These are the files, instructions and collaborations to build a open source "homemadable" printed face mask that aims to be easy to print,
protect against the 128nm COVID-19 virus both by passive filtration and by active virus suppression.
The aim is to have a mask that is better than the single use models, not for prolonged multiple use,
can be printed from any filament on any printer. The filters can be made at home using household materials, the active virus suppression is achieved by nano copper and nano silver particles also easily produced at home.

Collaboration is needed in:
* moving the cad design to FreeCAD
* co-ordinating participants
* testing the design
* measuring actual filtration, pressure differential and antibio performance
* continuously improving the design
