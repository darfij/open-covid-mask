2d3d mask printing instructions

Slicing:
Print with PLA, ABS, PETG or HIPS layer height 0.2mm, no support, 60% infill, no buildplate adhesion, buildplate temperature at 60 C. Other parameters depending on the material and printer used.

Elevate the model from the plate in Z axis direction to accommodate for fabric thickness (0.5mm). Alternatively, you can babystep the head up.
(for CURA: disable Automatically drop models to the build plate)

Printing:
Cut appropriate fabric to a 250x250mm square.
-If your bed size is 200x200 use laundry clips and clip the tightly stretched fabric to your print bead.
-If your bed is larger than 250x250 then position the printhead to bed center about +30mm in Z direction. Use 4 stretched paper clips trough the fabric corners to fasten the stretched fabric to bed corners. Pay attention that the fabric center is at the bed center (the current position of your print head)
If you did not slice with a +Z (0.5) babystep the head upwards.

Print

After the print has finished:
-detach the nose pinch
-cut the 4 center segments of fabric blocking the exhale valve with a exacto knife. take care that you do not cut the center cross with the hole. Make sure that no fabric fibers are left to hinder the valve function.
-use scissors and cut the fabric along the two outer lines (175mm), and at the ends making the finished mask approx. 174x 190mm 
-insert the strings (cca 460mm)one at each side. From the middle to the sides. tie the string protruding from the sides together.
 pull on the string middle until the mask forms to a curved shape.
- insert the nose pinch on the mask top center.
-make and insert the latex/rubber valve as per the valve instructions
