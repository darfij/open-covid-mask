Filter preparation (for fold and 3d masks)
Aim is to use home materials that have tested filtration capabilities, good „breathability“, and can be laced with nano coper, or nano silver or both.
Details and tested recommendations can be found in the links section.

Our filter example is made of 3 layers: 
-first layer of cotton cloth (pillowcase cloth) wetted with Ag nano particles and dried
-second layer of cotton pad (Maxi-pads) wetted with Cu nano particles and dried
-third layer again of cotton cloth (pillowcase cloth) wetted with Ag nano particles and dried

This has not been tested and definitely does not provide any form of certified filtration and therefore protection, but is our best guess from the currently available information.

Steps:
1. Cut 4 cotton cloth circles slightly larger than the filter hole (to about 45mm diameter)
2. Cut 2 cotton pad circles slightly larger than the filter hole (to about 45mm diameter)
3. Wet the 4 cotton cloth circles with nano Ag (about 5-7ml) solution. Leve to dry in a warm, dust free place.
4. Wet the 2 cotton pad circles with nano Cu (about 5-7ml) solution. Leve to dry in a warm, dust free place.
5. When dry, stack the two filters (each is: cotton cloth, cotton pad, cotton cloth)
6. Press the stacks in to the filter housing taking care that they are centered and fold symmetrically against the filter walls.
